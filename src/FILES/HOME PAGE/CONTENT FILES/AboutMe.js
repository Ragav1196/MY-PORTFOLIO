        <p>
          Hey! I'm <span>Ragav</span>, I've been fascinated by{" "}
          <span>technology</span> and <span>gadgets</span> since I was a kid,
          and I think this is what pushed me to become a{" "}
          <span>full stack developer</span>. I prefer to learn new things rather
          than repeat the same types of tasks, and this sector allows me to do
          so.
        </p>

        <p className="pageBrk">
          When I'm not coding, I like to <span>cook</span>, go on{" "}
          <span>bike rides</span> to some new places, and
          <span> binge watch movies</span>.
        </p>
